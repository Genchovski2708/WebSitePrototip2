    <p>
      Rural environments in themselves are communities that in public opinion are communities dominated by men, which on the other hand sets a different approach in research and in understanding the overall reality that is shown to us. It certainly entails the creation of precisely structured strategies to find a solution to reduce the gender gap that exists in such communities, which greatly affects both national and regional spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project is expected to integrate all levels: individual, group, cultural, ethnic, religious, gender, local, regional, national because the integration of the labor market, economic and social development cannot be followed only on one level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current complicated way of life has imposed the direction and structuring of many institutions and civil associations to be involved at all possible levels, in order to help women in the process of adapting to the new reality without major consequences (psychological, physical, mental, emotional, family).
    </p>
    <p>
      The current situation has alarmed and detected that we should take actions and get involved in the adjustment process ie. to involve all stakeholders in an evolutionary way, in order for the female population to be involved in acting and experiencing all things as a totality and not only as observer or repressed actors of social changes and processes. That is why we are taking the initiative to encourage women from rural areas to get involved in cooperation, direct involvement in projects that dictate social responsibility. We are called in a peculiar way to help in complementary processes and restructuring of new models related to:
    </p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li><p>
        Socialization, creating reciprocity, exchange of ideas and experiences, teamwork, psychophysical development, interaction in project activities with physical presence, activities, and competitions, and even conflicts that encourage understanding of diversity at several levels (equality, understanding and respect for differences in intercultural communication and emotional intelligence)      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Uninterrupted communication with the family, the environment (near and far), which will overcome the traditional barriers that still influence the choice of establishing an equivalence in the gender and spatial structure (urban and rural)
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Acceptance of the changed way of life in the outside world, and implementation of changes in the home as a normal course of modernity.
      </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Considering that our proposed project is initially aimed at positioning the problem, that is, we aim to detect in the planned regions all emerging problems related to transparency and the rooted tradition in the model of women's behavior when it relates to the public sector, i.e. the possibility of being involved in the new modern flows that are dictated by globalization, our intention is to investigate in one way the influence that dictates such a situation among women in the rural environment, and on the other hand to create policies of adaptation and real inclusion of women in all spheres that until then seemed unattainable to her or represented a taboo for the entire community, which is the spatial framework of our research.
    </p>
    <h2 class="block-heading">Project objectives</h2>
    <h4 class="sub-header indent" id="objectives">Main objective:</h4>
    <p class="indent">
      To promote and strengthen the interests of women from rural communities in order to create gender-sensitive policies in the planned regions, including partnership relations with other associations, and especially with local communities in order to enable technological and social development, as well as the awakening of eco-awareness for environmental conservation through cultural landscape mapping.
    </p>
    <h4 class="sub-header indent">Specific purpose:</h4>
    <ol class="indent">
      <li><p>
        Rural women should develop a sense of their own roadmap towards self-actualization, in order to be involved in the development and expansion of economic trends, by perceiving the role of domestic culture, as an indicator in the adaptation of women from rural communities to models of any character in the society.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Decent life of women in rural areas as part of civil society, in all spheres of public life in terms of thinking, acting, experiencing and benefiting the entire community, the region, etc.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Through the establishment of cooperation mechanisms and the initiation of a wide range of actions between the relevant actors at the local level in all planned regions, to enable a sense of involvement in the civil sector, business associations, etc. for equal opportunities at the local, regional and national level.      </p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="block-heading" id="expected-results">Expected results</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      Establishing horizontal and vertical gender connections, giving greater possibility of decentralization, social inclusion in all pores of social upheavals. Through these results, we will build a conceptualized, systematized and complementary cooperation of women from rural areas related to social communities and their coordination in order to create conditions for a worthy place for women, regardless of whether it is rural or urban areas.
    </p>
    <h2 class="block-heading" id="target-group">Target group</h2>
    <p class="indent">
      Rural women from the intended regions in science are still named as a marginalized group, namely representing traditional women:
    </p>
    <ol class="indent">
      <li><p>
        Women who exclusively function according to the traditional model of living, ie. with accepted roles according to the hierarchy of the extended traditional family
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Women from different ethnoreligious groups who are educated and live in extended traditional families and are part of the traditional part      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Women victims of domestic violence due to unwritten rules imposed by tradition (customary law, Sharia law)
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Single mothers and widows, victims of the traditional model of living
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Women with a lower educational profile
      </p></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="indent">
      Such rural groups are particularly affected by unequal treatment and a low level of participation in economic, social, cultural and political developments in the community and participate very little in civic activism at the local level, which is why they are not involved in receiving support at various levels from the local community. Women in rural areas are faced with all the difficulties starting from the family environment, neighborhood cooperativeness, and the need to include certain activities related to the social responsibility of the local community.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Precisely because of the division of male and female roles in rural areas, which refer to the traditional model of living, they most often (report) as victims of domestic violence, discrimination. This entails the need for versatile research on a horizontal and vertical level, in order to arrive at relevant indicators, ie. indicators that will indicate the real picture of accessibility to quality social, health and economic services by rural women.
