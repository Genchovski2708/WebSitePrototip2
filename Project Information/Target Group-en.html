            Rural women from the intended regions in science are still named as a marginalized group, namely representing traditional women:

        <ol class="indent">
            <li><p>
                Women who exclusively function according to the traditional model of living, ie. with accepted roles according to the hierarchy of the extended traditional family
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Women from different ethnoreligious groups who are educated and live in extended traditional families and are part of the traditional part      </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Women victims of domestic violence due to unwritten rules imposed by tradition (customary law, Sharia law)
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Single mothers and widows, victims of the traditional model of living

            Such rural groups are particularly affected by unequal treatment and a low level of participation in economic, social, cultural and political developments in the community and participate very little in civic activism at the local level, which is why they are not involved in receiving support at various levels from the local community. Women in rural areas are faced with all the difficulties starting from the family environment, neighborhood cooperativeness, and the need to include certain activities related to the social responsibility of the local community.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Precisely because of the division of male and female roles in rural areas, which refer to the traditional model of living, they most often (report) as victims of domestic violence, discrimination. This entails the need for versatile research on a horizontal and vertical level, in order to arrive at relevant indicators, ie. indicators that will indicate the real picture of accessibility to quality social, health and economic services by rural women.
