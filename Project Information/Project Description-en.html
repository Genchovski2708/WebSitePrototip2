        <p>
            Rural environments in themselves are communities that in public opinion are communities dominated by men, which on the other hand sets a different approach in research and in understanding the overall reality that is shown to us. It certainly entails the creation of precisely structured strategies to find a solution to reduce the gender gap that exists in such communities, which greatly affects both national and regional spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project is expected to integrate all levels: individual, group, cultural, ethnic, religious, gender, local, regional, national because the integration of the labor market, economic and social development cannot be followed only on one level.
        </p>
        <p>
            The current complicated way of life has imposed the direction and structuring of many institutions and civil associations to be involved at all possible levels, in order to help women in the process of adapting to the new reality without major consequences (psychological, physical, mental, emotional, family).
        </p>
        <p>
            The current situation has alarmed and detected that we should take actions and get involved in the adjustment process ie. to involve all stakeholders in an evolutionary way, in order for the female population to be involved in acting and experiencing all things as a totality and not only as observer or repressed actors of social changes and processes. That is why we are taking the initiative to encourage women from rural areas to get involved in cooperation, direct involvement in projects that dictate social responsibility. We are called in a peculiar way to help in complementary processes and restructuring of new models related to:
        </p>
        <ul class="indent">
            <li><p>
                Socialization, creating reciprocity, exchange of ideas and experiences, teamwork, psychophysical development, interaction in project activities with physical presence, activities, and competitions, and even conflicts that encourage understanding of diversity at several levels (equality, understanding and respect for differences in intercultural communication and emotional intelligence)      </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Uninterrupted communication with the family, the environment (near and far), which will overcome the traditional barriers that still influence the choice of establishing an equivalence in the gender and spatial structure (urban and rural)
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Acceptance of the changed way of life in the outside world, and implementation of changes in the home as a normal course of modernity.
            </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Considering that our proposed project is initially aimed at positioning the problem, that is, we aim to detect in the planned regions all emerging problems related to transparency and the rooted tradition in the model of women's behavior when it relates to the public sector, i.e. the possibility of being involved in the new modern flows that are dictated by globalization, our intention is to investigate in one way the influence that dictates such a situation among women in the rural environment, and on the other hand to create policies of adaptation and real inclusion of women in all spheres that until then seemed unattainable to her or represented a taboo for the entire community, which is the spatial framework of our research.
