    <p>
      Realizing the common goals and tasks to which the partner organizations are directed, namely the reduction of economic, social, educational and cultural differences in society, by providing a high level of research and expertise for local and regional actors in the field of social development as citizens with the same human rights, our involvement is imposed not only temporarily while the project lasts, but to give our contribution to the continuity and sustainability of such projects that lead to the improvement of civil society at all levels (horizontal and vertical).
    </p>
    <p>
      Our intention also includes equivalence in the methodology and the chosen methods that are designed and agreed upon with the partners based on the professional, practical experience of each of the partners and the real needs of the target group, thus ensuring the successful implementation of all project activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that way, the partnership ensures the strengthening and sustainability of the project, because it creates new bases for creating a model with the possibility of combining the best practices needed at the local and regional level, in a unique way it will be reflected at the global level. The project partnership is structured to ensure that best practices, experience, models and lessons learned can be effectively and efficiently adapted to develop a sustainable approach to project implementation.

      The main activities of the Institute of Culture and Art are related to the problems in culture and art, the processes aimed at the development and transformation of modern challenges, conditioned by the global process in culture, and aimed at the humanization of relations in culture.
    </p>
    <p class="indent align-left">The main activities include:</p>
    <ol class="indent align-left">
      <li><p>Programming of scientific - research work</p></li>
      <li><p>Research work in the context of types of culture and in the sphere of art</p></li>

      The evolution of the scientific-research activity through the mutual connection of science and education in coordination with the subjects in the sphere of culture and art simultaneously determines the goal for the continued existence of our Institute. Achieving significant scientific results through domestic and international cooperation through knowledge exchange, research, training as well as application in joint projects in intercultural development in general.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The target group of our Institute is multidimensional, aimed at: the young population, starting with high school students; the students; domestic and foreign scientific research institutions; experts from various organizational and institutional project teams for the realization of joint projects.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      At the regional level, the common challenges that are affecting us in the long term at different levels require us to take a series of strategic and innovative measures that should be aimed exclusively at finding common solutions and overcoming all the obstacles caused by traditional ways of living. Taking into account that the Balkans as a regional area is very complex, this implies that the inclusion of partnership relations only in the Balkans can cause bias in cultural diversity, and our intention is always to have representatives outside of this region as partners. This will also contribute to the objectivity of research related to the subject, goals and tasks of the project

      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Work with young people (including young Roma) and inclusion; starting from 2016 we initiated research and scientific publications on a volunteer basis focusing on the situation of professional competencies of young people and recognizing their participation in the labor market. We also investigate the representatives of the immigrant social class of Romania within the EU after the liberalization of the labor market.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Volunteer work and inclusion: we aim to promote activities between students and schools from secondary schools by involving them in more informal types of education.
